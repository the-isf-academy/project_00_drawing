# Assessment

When your project is finished (or before if it's helpful), assess your project. Read the [project rubric](http://cs.fablearn.org/projects/0-drawing project.html) and then decide how your project should score on each category. Write a paragraph for each category justifying this assessment with evidence from your code, planning documents, and commit messages.

## Decomposition and abstraction
My project ---- expectations on this category. Here's why.
