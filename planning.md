# Project plan

## The idea 

Replace this text with a description of the drawing you want to make. (It would be nice to also explain why you want to make this drawing.) It's helpful, but not required, to include a sketch of what you are planning. If you want to add an image, you can do so like this:

## Decomposition

Again, replace this text with an explanation of how you plan to decompose the project into smaller parts. This should include a list of the functions you think you will write, and how they will fit together. Also describe how you will organize these functions into modules. Again, sketches are helpful but not required.

## Milestones

- **Milestone 0**: What will be finished when you are halfway done with the project? (When half the work time is used up, we will check in on our milestones and make changes to the project if necessary, to make sure we can finish on time.)
