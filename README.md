# Unit 0 Project: Drawing

This is the starter code for [Project 0: Drawing](http://cs.fablearn.org/projects/0-drawing%20project.html). 
Here's what is included:

- `README.md` You're looking at it, or at least the formatted version. (Click "raw" to see the unformatted version.) Every project has a README explaining what it is.
- `project.py` When this is run, it should draw your project. (If your project is well-organized, there might not be much code in `project.py`. Instead, it might import functions from other modules.)
- `planning.md` This is where you will write your project proposal.
- `assessment.md` This is where you will write your self-assessment of your project.
